You can install Invention using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

## Quick start

Make sure that PHP is installed globally, otherwise the app might not work properly.
Go to your project directory and run:

```
$ php console serve
```

This will start PHP's build in development web server on `localhost:8080`.
