In short, layouts are the blueprints for the views. Using layouts can make our code less. If your website has multiple pages, then there is a great chance of having some common HTML code such as header, footer, navbar, copyright text... etc. And you can keep these common code in a single file, which is generally a layout. Creating a layout is very simple, navigate to resources/views/layouts/ directory and create a new file main.php . Also you can create main.power.php if you want to use PowerParser. Then open the file and add these things if you're not using PowerParser: <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>My First App</title> </head> <body> [[ view ]] </body> </html> Alternatively, add these things if you're using PowerParser: <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>My First App</title> </head> <body> :yield('content') </body> </html> Then, you need to extend this layout in other views. Now, in the first case we've used [[ view ]] and this tells your app that replace that token with the incoming view content. The :yield() directive is almost same as [[ view ]] . If you're not using PowerParser, then you need to open the config/app.php file add edit the layout field and add the layout path to the field. In this case, it is layouts/main . Note that the extensions are not allowed here, just pass the base name. Then you can create a new view test.php and then add some code: <h1>Hello world!</h1> <p>Your layout and view(s) are working!</p> And now you can add a test route to the routes/web.php file which simply returns a view (In this case it is test ): Route::get('/testing-a-view', function(){ return view('test'); }); And hopefully in the browser you should see the title My First App which means the layout is working and you should also see other stuff in the view. Now, if you're using PowerParser, then follow these steps: Create a new view test.power.php (Remember, the extension .power.php tells your app that it is a PowerParser file, and .php tells you app that it is a simple PHP file.): :extends('layouts.main') :section('content') <h1>Hello world!</h1> <p>Your layout and view(s) are working!</p> :endsection And then add a new route as done before.
